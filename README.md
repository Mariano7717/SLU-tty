# SLU-tty
SSH hosts Listing and Unified credential manager


/*--- 2024 May 27 - Branch = Programming language to use ---*/
Continued through coding some functions and setting some logic, will continue with the credential logic before deciding on the host script order
For now my idea is to be able to connect to hosts based on infividual hosts or based also on tags
was thinking on how possible or complex would be to connect to a set of hosts based on tags
(i.e: connect to main routers on a specific location at once given locationi and type of device tags)

This sounds like a job for Xojo or something similar: http://www.xojo.com
Mac, Windows, Linux builds with easy GUI design and native apps. Custom UI easily done also, and you'd then have one code base for all three platforms. You can download and use the software for free to develop and test, only requires a license once you decide to build your app.

/*--- 2024 May 26 - Initial idea ---*/

SLU-tty repository created with the AIM of developing an application able to perform SSH connections to other devices via terminal.
Must be able to run in a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
Must be able to import / export a list of hosts and credentials in CSV and / or encrypted format
